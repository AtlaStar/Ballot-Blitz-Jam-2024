		Susan: Unfortunately, money is tight with the cost of living, and without something like Universal Basic Income, I just won't be able to take time off to go and vote out Mr. Tode.
		- Oh no...
			Susan: I know, it is really unfortunate...
		- What if I could talk to Carol
			Susan: I guess? I am not sure I think it will make a difference...probably about as much a difference as voting against Mr. Tode will...
